## About This Site

This is a custom-built, three-page portfolio site designed to showcase my projects, professional experience, and skills as a Senior Data Analyst and Project Manager. The goal was to create a clean, professional, and consistent user experience that effectively communicates the business impact of my work.

The site was built using a combination of modern web technologies and templates, unified under a single, cohesive design theme.

* **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and designed to be easily navigable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Three-Page Structure**:
    * **Projects**: A landing page that highlights key end-to-end data analysis projects.
    * **About Me**: A page dedicated to my professional background, personal interests, and community involvement.
    * **Interactive Resume**: A dynamic, single-page application that presents my professional experience and quantifiable achievements in an engaging format.
* **Consistent Branding**: All pages share a unified theme, including a sticky navigation bar, consistent typography and color scheme, and a professional footer.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive layout.
* Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements, such as the timeline on the resume page and the mobile navigation menu.
* Font Awesome for social media icons.

This repository is a great example of how I approach a project: starting with a clear vision, focusing on user experience, and ensuring a polished final product.
